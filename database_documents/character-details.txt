In characters.sql table, characters are identified by column "objid".  The number from "objid" is used in multiple locations.
- characters_items.sql
- character_einhasadstat.sql
- character_einhasadfaith.sql
- character_config.sql

But we are mainly focusing on characters_items.sql file, which contains all the items the character has.

In the character_items.sql, we have column label "is_equipped".  These items should go into the Equipment Card on character-detail.php if there is a "1". Also, if it's equipped it means, it's either an armor, or weapon.  Which "item_id" should match "item_id" in armor.sql and weapon.sql. Once we get here, we need to check column "iconId" which holds the image name. 

If the "is_equipped" equals 0, then it should go into the inventory card on character-detail.php.

In characters_items.sql file, we also have column "item_id", which is the number we need to focus on getting images, and figuring out what kinda of item it is. As state above we already figure out if it's armor/weapon simply by the column "is_equpped".  But for items, and others we need to match "item_id" with "item_id" in etcitem.sql table.  Inside the etcitem.sql table, we need to grab two things, "desc_en" name of the item in english, and "iconId" image name inside the /assets/img/icons/icons/ directory, these should match.
